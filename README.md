To go more in depth with this project, it is a maze/breakout game that I designed for my final project. It is designed to be a stealth game. The game consists of 6 rooms, 5 rooms that the player can navigate through to find 5 different clues, 1 in each room. The clues are randomly stored amongst the room so the user cannot just memorize it.
There are also guards implemented into the rooms that also move randomly around the room, if you are caught by one the program ends.
The player can only see 2 tiles in each direction making it more challenging and more of a actual maze. 
The maze part comes from the room being designed like a maze, the walls are barriers which neither the useror the guard can move through.
The door is how the user gets out and goes to the other rooms.
There is also a secret room in one of the rooms which is an easter egg and whoever found it in my class got candy from me.
The last room is the code room, which is a 5 digit code that the user has to guess correctly to see the hidden message behind the code.
If the user guesses any of the numbers right, it will tell them, but they have to guess it in the right spots or else it wont tell them.
If the player tells me the secret message then they will get a reward from me (which was candy, lol)
This game was played by my classmates on the last day of school.
